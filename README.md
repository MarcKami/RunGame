# RunPrototype

This Prototype took me 3:30h to be completed. The main point is try to prototype fast to be able to confirm that one feature or idea could work and could engaging.

The most difficult part were the mathematical part to move the camera in a circular movement over time when the player reach the doors zone. This wasn't a huge problem, but to do it asap I've made a simple Lerp between angles and you need to take care about if they are in deg or rad and which are the origin and the target angles.

Oviously all the feedback could be better, the movement of the player and of course the movement of the camera. 

If I could go a step further on this prototype, the first thing that I'd fix would be the camera movement and the mathematical part to do it. Optimizing the process and doing it more versatile. Other thing to add and go further is add more obstacles to ensure that the prototype has variations and it isn't boring or repetitive.

I think that in this example and in a videogame development enviroment, the most important thing is try to prototype your idea as fast as you can but without forgetting to made it funny and stable.
